<h2>Employment</h2>

<h3>FusePump - 2012 July to present</h3>

<p>During my time at FusePump I have initiated and delivered a wide range of interesting and technically challenging projects. Using knowledge of machine learning techniques from my masters’ degree, I built an Artificial Intelligence category mapper in node.js to intelligently guess how a product should be categorised based on its name. I also built an interactive HTML5 advertising widget using coffeescript, an automated code deployment system in PHP and set up continuous testing with Jenkins. In addition to my programming experience at FusePump, I introduced Git to the company, started a practice of regular code audits and open sourced several internal projects on Github. I have also given internal training sessions on a variety of topics as well as writing several internal blog posts on new and interesting technologies.</p>

<h3>Buildr - Eight week internship</h3>

<p>During the summer of 2011 I worked for a web start-up that was looking at creating a new way of collaboratively making photobooks online. I was heavily involved in coding in PHP, Javascript, HTML and CSS while also interacting with databases including MySQL and MongoDB. Working with Buildr also gave me valuable experience of working within a small group of people where it was important to take the initiative and proactively suggest changes that I thought were necessary. I learnt to react quickly and be adaptive in this rapidly changing environment that is unique to start-ups.</p>

<h3>E.ON UK - 2 eight week summer placements</h3>

<p>I was selected for the Power Academy scheme in my first year at Imperial College. During my internships and activities with E.ON UK, I worked on various projects and had the opportunity to give annual presentations to students as well. To complete the tasks assigned to me to the high standard I always strive for, I had to find contacts in different departments and communicate effectively for the information I required. This was an opportunity to understand what work in a large organisation was like, and also to learn about management level responsibilities.</p>

<h2>Other achievements</h2>

<h3>Live Union stats - 2012</h3>

<p>During the 2012 Imperial College Union elections I was approached by the Union to build a real time, interactive statistics page on the voting processes to increase participation in the elections. Already having an interest in real time web technologies I embraced the project. Using node.js and socket.io I built a system that would push voting statistics to hundreds of users simultaneously without putting undue strain on the servers. On the front-end, to display the statistics in a user friendly way, I used Backbone.js to structure the app and D3.js to create interactive graphs on various aspects of the demographic of voters. The site was a huge success with at one point over 100 users simultaneously viewing the site.</p>

<h3>TEDxAlbertopolis - 2013 - <a href="http://tedxalbertopolis.com/">tedxalbertopolis.com</a></h3>

<p>For the TEDx event at the Royal Albert hall this year I was asked by the organisers to create a website to showcase the talks. The site is fully responsive as it was built with mobile and tablet browsers in mind and built on a node.js stack. </p>

<h3>Felix Website Design - 2010 - <a href="http://felixonline.co.uk/">felixonline.com</a></h3>

<p>My first serious experience with web development was rebuilding the Imperial College student newspaper’s website Felix. I knew certain changes could be made to improve reader experience and I was looking for a challenge to allow me to build up my skills in web design. As Felix is a well-established publication with an audience of over a thousand readers weekly, I had to cater to my client&#39;s requests to ensure that this project was delivered to their expectations and in keeping with my high standards. The project was a great success with the number of online visitors increasing by almost 50%. I am still in charge of maintaining the site and implementing new features such as an API and a mobile site, but I am focusing on properly documenting the code so that future web admins can work on the platform I built from scratch.</p>

<h3>Photographic Society Chair - 2009 to 2010</h3>

<p>The society had floundered in previous years, and was at risk of redundancy due to an unmotivated committee. My passion for photography meant I became a very active member in my first year, and was elected as Chair in my second year.  In order to make the best use of its resources and potential, I worked very hard with my committee and we managed to increase use of the darkroom and doubled memberships by the end of the year.  I have taken on an advisory position this year and am delighted that there now is momentum to achieve greater progress.</p>
